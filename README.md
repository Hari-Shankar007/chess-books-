# Chess Book Library

A desktop application for managing your chess book collection. Built with Electron, this app allows you to organize, search, and read your PDF chess books with automatic cover generation and metadata management.

## Features

- **PDF Management**: Upload and store chess books in PDF format
- **Automatic Cover Generation**: First-page covers auto-generated using PDF.js
- **Local Storage**: All PDFs stored locally in a `books/` folder for persistent access
- **Metadata**: Add titles, authors, ratings, notes, levels, and phases
- **Search & Filter**: Find books by title, author, level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), or phase (Opening/Middlegame/Endgame)
- **In-App PDF Viewer**: Read books directly in the application
- **External Viewer**: Open books in your system's default PDF viewer
- **Edit & Delete**: Modify book information or remove books from your library
- **Persistent Data**: All library data saved in `library.json` - nothing vanishes on reload
